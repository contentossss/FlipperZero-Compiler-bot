<h1 align="center">What's that?</h1>

This project was created to make it easier for users to compile and customize the firmware for their Flipper Zero without the need for a computer or additional hardware. Users can transfer and include their own files directly from their phone while on-the-go, at a bar or with a friend. 

Additionally, we have created a [Telegram channel](https://t.me/FlipperZeroFirmwaresUpdate) to manage and display the releases of the major official and unofficial firmwares in an organized manner.

<h1 align="center">Customizations</h1>

- Firmware selection: you can choose between the official firmware and various custom options.
- Version selection: you can choose whether to download the firmware updated to the latest commit on the project (which might be unstable), or choose from the last three releases.
- Name customization: you can change the name of your Flipper to whatever you like.
- Animation customization: use your own GIFs to make your Flipper unique.
- SubGhz limitations: you can choose to remove national limitations and unlock general frequencies (please note that this option could damage your device).

More features are coming soon! Stay tuned for updates.
